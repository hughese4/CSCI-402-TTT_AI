This evaluateBoardHeuristic function starts by granting a large score for a win or a significant penalty 
for a loss. Then it evaluates each row, column, and diagonal for potential victories or needs to block the 
opponent.

The evaluateLine function assesses individual lines and rewards lines where the player is near victory 
and penalizes lines where the opponent is near victory.

The scores for the center and corners are added because these are typically strategic positions. 
The CENTER_SCORE and CORNER_SCORE values are somewhat arbitrary; you might fine-tune these based 
on your AI's performance.

Since the evaluate function is now using methods of the Board class, you may need to make some public 
methods which are currently private if they are required by the evaluateBoardHeuristic method from the 
MoveLogic class.
